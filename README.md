Quiz Game TRUE or FALSE

Welcome to the Quiz Game! In this project, we will focus on creating classes using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to build a true-false quiz game.

## Project Overview

Throughout this project, you will learn how to:
- Create custom classes in Python.
- Use these classes to create a true-false quiz game.
- Play the quiz, answer questions, and keep track of the score.

## Features

- **True-False Quiz**: A quiz game where each question can be answered with true or false.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of the player's score as they answer each question.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Build the entire game using custom classes and objects.

## Example Question

Here is an example of what you will be able to create:

Question 1: A slug's blood is green.
True
False
